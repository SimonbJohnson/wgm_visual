		<p><a href="https://hetco.io/">Hetco</a> was commissioned by the Public Engagement department at Wellcome Trust to conduct a research review project, that enhances the findings of the first <a href="https://wellcome.ac.uk/reports/wellcome-global-monitor/2018">Wellcome Global Monitor 2018</a> to reveal and prompt meaningful opportunities for research for teams within Wellcome. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1G4R-2QhrRNwNZa0VbtilW1ZAscT_ybdm/view?pli=1">We identified patterns</a> within the dataset, and worked with Studio Ala and Smithery to help communicate the complexity of the findings.</p> 


		<p>The resulting lenses of Religion, Societal Institutions, Benefits and Future Economies are designed to help scientists, programme managers and policy-makers consider trust in science from different points of view. Each lens was developed by combining questions from the WGM.</p>
