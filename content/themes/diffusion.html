		<h2>The role of societal context on trust in science</h2>
		<p class="tagline">How South Africa’s experiences with the state may be influencing perceptions of science and scientists</p>
		<p>A lack of confidence in their major societal institutions - national government, neighbours, charities and journalists may lower a person’s trust in science and scientists.</p>
		<p>South Africa ranks in the top 20% globally for distrust in its members of society, with the government being the least trusted of all members of society (53% of citizens distrust the government). Vietnam ranks average globally for distrust in scientists but ranks 140/144 for trust in scientists, despite having above average levels of trust in its society.</p>

	<h3>The case of Vietnam</h3>
		<p>Vietnam shows low levels of distrust in society but higher levels of distrust in science and scientists. From a global level, this level of distrust in science and scientists is average, but intriguingly, Vietnam one of the lowest in the world for saying they trust science and scientists. They have very large proportions replying “don’t know”.</p>

		<h3>Key Takeaway</h3>
		<p>Socio-political events and societal actors play an important role in the public perception of trust in science. Some of these events are well known - others less so. Understanding the existing landscape and contextualising interventions is neccessary to ensure uptake and adoption.</p>
