					<h3>Low distrust ≠ Trust in Vietnam </h3>
					<p>Vietnam shows low levels of distrust in society but higher levels of distrust in science and scientists. From a global level, this level of distrust in science and scientists is average, but intriguingly, Vietnam one of the lowest in the world for saying they trust science and scientists. They have very large proportions replying “don’t know”.</p>
					<p>Vietnam showed no relationship between trust in science and trust in other members of society. It had one of the highest rates in the world for trust in traditional healers - medical examination and treatment with traditional is governed by a special department in the ministry and covered by health insurance.</p>
