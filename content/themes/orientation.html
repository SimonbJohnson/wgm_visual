		<p>According to WGM 2018, People who live in LMIC countries are more likely to identify
		as religious as compared to the rest of the world. y% of them report an uncomplicated
		side-by-side relationship of faith in religion and science. When the two schools of
		thought disagree - x% of them create a hierarchy, elevating religion over science. In an
		effort to gain an insight into the extent to which religiosity impacts health behaviours -
		we integrated the responses from three questions in the WGM.</p>

		<p>Religion and traditions co-exist with scientific authority in
			everyday life in LMIC countries. Most people globally and in
			LMIC countries report an uncomplicated side-by-side relationship
			of faith in religion and science. This uncomplicated relationship
			has also been reported by Falade’s research on cognitive polyphasia,
			cognitive dissonance and attitudes to science in Nigeria</p>

		<p>Instance #1 how a person in India who received both traditional and scientific medicine treatments “The medication (for jaundice) was available, my parents first took me to a doctor but apart from a doctor, my grandmother and grandfather had some superstitious belief, and they used to take me to a person who would apply something yellow on my body and remove it, he used to do this daily. I don’t know whether I got cured due to medication or because of the superstitious belief”</p>

		<p>Instance #2 : how an uncomplicated relationship lead to a positive cross-referral system for mental health in Ghana; The health-care system supporting mental health in Ghana appears to have evolved into a collaboration between Western clinicians and traditional African and Western religious healers. These interactions consist of a ‘cross-referral system’, which is, however, largely unofficial. A pastor told the Ae-Ngibise et al. (2010) that he normally referred his patients to the hospital first, before asking them to fast and pray. A Muslim healer also said that he referred patients to the hospital if he had tried all other possible methods and the ailment persisted. In addition, a health programme director reported the need for a relationship between clinicians and faith-based healers, since he had seen successful management in cases in which the church encouraged patients</p>

		<p>A large number of people do not see any disagreement between their religious belief systems but have low trust in science. This might be because they believe that religion outweighs science in every way or that they have low trust in both religion and science. However, this is speculative and further research is needed.</p>
